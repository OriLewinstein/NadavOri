        Customers want to be treated like human beings. For that to happen, they
        need to feel that they're being served by human beings. When finishing
        your About page, describe who you are as a person or a team, and what
        your personal values are. What's your company culture like? What bigger
        picture in life drives your business? Keep in mind a secondary audience
        of your company's About page consists of your future employees. This is
        another reason describing your personal values is a good idea â€” the key
        to your job candidates' hearts is to show them you have one too.<br /><br />
